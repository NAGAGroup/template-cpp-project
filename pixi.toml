# ======= pixi-build (rattler-build) Configuration =======
# NOTE: Recipes in the recipe/ directory can be built independently
# with rattler-build for creating conda packages:
#
#   rattler-build build recipe/recipe.yaml              # Build with DPC++
#   rattler-build build recipe/recipe-gcc.yaml          # Build with GCC
#   rattler-build build recipe/recipe-clang.yaml        # Build with Clang
#   rattler-build build recipe/recipe-mingw.yaml        # Build with MinGW
#
# These recipes use the pixi-build-rattler-build backend, allowing
# custom toolchains (like DPC++) that aren't available in conda-forge's
# default compilers.
#
# For full pixi integration with package building, the workspace would
# need to be restructured with a [package] section. This is deferred
# as pixi-build is still in preview and APIs may change.

# ======= Project environment Variables =======

# affect all toolchains
